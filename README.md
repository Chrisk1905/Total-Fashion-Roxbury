# Total Fashion Roxbury Landing Page and Content Management System

A web app built as a landing page and content managment system for an alterations and dry cleaning shop. 

I wanted to give a local dry cleaners an oinline presence with a mobile responsive website, and a way to manage its contents with updates.

### How to use

The web site is currently deployed here.
